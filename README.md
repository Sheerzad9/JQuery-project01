This is my first project using JQuery.
In this application you can search a country and get its recent Covid-19 records. In addition EU-countries will have extra data which shows their current travel status.
I have used 3 different API:s in this project (Rest Countries - to print searched nations flag, Covid-19 data API, to show covid stats, and EU-Covid-19 Travel API to show travel
status). The site is also responsive thanks to Bootstrap :-)
