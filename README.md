This is my first project using JQuery.
In this application you can search a country and get its recent Covid-19 records. In addition EU-countries will have extra data which shows their current travel status.
I have used 3 different API:s in this project 
* Rest Countries - to print searched nations flag.
* Covid-19 data API, to show covid stats
* EU-Covid-19 Travel API to show travel status. 
The site is also responsive thanks to Bootstrap. üôè
I have also coded little bit error handling

## Searching data of Turkey, notice that because Turkey isn't EU-country we wont be able to show travel status(that API works only for EU-countries)
